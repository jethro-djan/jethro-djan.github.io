      <p>Hi. My name is Jethro.</p>
      <p>I wear a coat of many colours (biblical reference). I have quite a number of interests that I pursue. I am a basic school teacher, mathematician (in the making), software developer, and now, founder of startup.</p>
      <p>For those interested in my mathematical journey, my research interests lie in in geometric group theory, applications of geometry and topology to machine learning and data analysis, and low dimensional topology.</p>
      <p>Find me on <a href="https://www.x.com/JethroDjan/">X (formally Twitter)</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jethro-djan/">LinkedIn</a> if you want to chat. You can also email me on jthryeboah[AT]gmail.com if you want to collaborate on a project or ask me anything else.</p>
